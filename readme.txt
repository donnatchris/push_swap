PROJECT PUSH_SWAP FOR 42
- By chdonnat (Christophe Donnat from 42 Perpignan, France)

AIM OF THE PROJECT:

The Push swap project is a simple and efficient algorithmic exercise:
you need to sort data.
You have at your disposal a set of integers, two stacks,
and a set of instructions to manipulate them.
Your goal? Write a C program named push_swap that calculates
and displays on the standard output the smallest program,
made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers passed as parameters.

SOME COMMANDS YOU CAN USE:

make
	compiles the push_swap program
make bonus
	compiles the checker program
make fclean
	remove all .o files and executable files generated by the make command
ARG=$(./tests/test_generator 500)
	generate a list of 500 integers (without doubles) separated by spaces
	and assign the list to the variable ARG
	(you can choose anothe number like 100 or 5 for exemple)
./push_swap "$ARG" | wc -l
	counts the number of steps used by push_swap to sort the numbers in ARG
./push_swap "$ARG" | ./tests/checker_Mac "$ARG"
	for Mac
	verifies the output of push_swap by using the 42 tester:
	returns OK if the output of push_swap sorts the numbers in ARG
	or returns KO if not
	returns error if there was an error
./push_swap "$ARG" | ./tests/checker_linux "$ARG"
	same as above but for linux
./push_swap "$ARG" | ./checker "$ARG"
	same as above but using my own tester (made for the bonus of the project)
