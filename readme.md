# PROJECT PUSH_SWAP FOR 42
By chdonnat (Christophe Donnat from 42 Perpignan, France)

## AIM OF THE PROJECT:
The Push swap project is a simple and efficient algorithmic exercise:
you need to sort data.
You have at your disposal a set of integers, two stacks,
and a set of instructions to manipulate them.
Your goal? Write a C program named push_swap that calculates
and displays on the standard output the smallest program,
made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers passed as parameters.
### BONUS
Make your own checker program to test the output of you push_swap program

## ARCHITECTURE:
- **src/** directory for the main files of the mandatory part
- **utils/** directory for secondary files of the mandatory part
- **includes/** directory for header files
- **bonus/** directory for the bonus part
- **tests/** directory with:
	- checker files for Mac and Linux (give,n with the subjet)
 	- a test_generator that can generate a list of numbers to test push_swap
- **libft/** directory with my own library (standard functions, ft_printf, get_next_line)
- **Makefile** (with rules: make bonus clean fclean re):
- **readme.md** for explanations and main commands of the project

## SOME COMMANDS YOU CAN USE:

compile the push_swap program:

	make
 
compile the checker program:

	make bonus
 
remove all .o files and executable files generated by the make command:

	make fclean

generate a list of n integers (without doubles) separated by spaces
and assign the list to the variable ARG **("n" must be a positive integer of your choice)**:

	 ARG=$(./tests/test_generator <n>)

count the number of steps used by push_swap to sort the numbers in ARG:

	./push_swap "$ARG" | wc -l

verify the output of push_swap by using the 42 tester ON MACOS
(returns OK if the output of push_swap sorts the numbers in ARG,
or returns KO if not, and returns error if there was an error):

	./push_swap "$ARG" | ./tests/checker_Mac "$ARG"

 same as above but for LINUX:

	./push_swap "$ARG" | ./tests/checker_linux "$ARG"

 same as above but using my own tester (made for the bonus of the project):

	./push_swap "$ARG" | ./checker "$ARG"
