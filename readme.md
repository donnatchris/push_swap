# PROJECT PUSH_SWAP FOR 42
- By chdonnat (Christophe Donnat from 42 Perpignan, France)

## AIM OF THE PROJECT:

The Push swap project is a simple and efficient algorithmic exercise:
you need to sort data.
You have at your disposal a set of integers, two stacks,
and a set of instructions to manipulate them.
Your goal? Write a C program named push_swap that calculates
and displays on the standard output the smallest program,
made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers passed as parameters.

## SOME COMMANDS YOU CAN USE:

compile the push_swap program

	make

compile the checker program

	make bonus

remove all .o files generated by the make command

	make clean

generate a list of 500 integers (without doubles) separated by spaces
and assign the list to the variable ARG
(you can choose anothe number like 100 or 5 for exemple)
 
	ARG=$(./tests/test_generator 500)

count the number of steps used by push_swap to sort the numbers in ARG

	./push_swap "$ARG" | wc -l
 
for Mac:
verifiy the output of push_swap by using the 42 tester:
returns OK if the output of push_swap sorts the numbers in ARG
or returns KO if not
returns error if there was an error

	./push_swap "$ARG" | ./tests/checker_Mac "$ARG"

same as above but for linux

	./push_swap "$ARG" | ./tests/checker_linux "$ARG"

same as above but using my own tester (made for the bonus of the project)

	./push_swap "$ARG" | ./checker "$ARG"

## About My Algorithm
I used a fairly standard sorting algorithm for a push_swap (compared to what you'll find online). Essentially, the program pushes all the values to sort onto stack B, leaving only 3 values on stack A, which it sorts directly.
From there, the program identifies the value to bring back to the correct position in stack A (similar to insertion sort) by choosing the one that requires the fewest moves. It then moves that value to the correct position in stack A and repeats the process until stack B is empty.
Finally, it performs a rotation on stack A to place the smallest value at the top.

If you'd like to see a much more original sorting approach (which requires fewer calculations, even if it needs more moves), I coded a push_swap that uses three recursive functions. It was a real puzzle to implement, but the result is very satisfying. Unfortunately, I didn’t use this version for the 42 project because it couldn’t achieve the best score for sorting 100 values. It takes over 700 moves for 100 values but stays under 5500 moves for 500 values.
You can find this algorithm in my other repository:

recursive_push_swap.
